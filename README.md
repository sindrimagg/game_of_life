# Conway's Game of Life
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Rust, without
any dependencies. It prints to the terminal instead of using some
external graphical interface. There are some example patterns in
the Examples directory.
    
## Usage
For example to use the pattern *Examples/glider.txt*, if you are
in the main directory it can be played out by using
```
cargo run -- Examples/glider.txt
```

## TODO
 - Add possibility to move the frame
 - Add easier configuration of speed and ability to stop
